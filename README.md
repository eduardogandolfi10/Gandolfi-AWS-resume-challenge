# Gandolfi-AWS-resume-challenge
This is the work done as part of the AWS Cloud resume challenge. You can find more information on the challenge here https://cloudresumechallenge.dev/docs/the-challenge/aws/

We used Terraform for the IaC, and python for the lambda function to retrieve backend data and testing.
In AWS we used API Gateway, Lambda and DynamoDB for the Backend, for the frontend we used S3, route53 and cloudfront.
